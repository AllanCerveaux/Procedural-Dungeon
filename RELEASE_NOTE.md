# Release Notes

> Disclaimer : I am a French developer, my English limits this to English video games and the different documentation I read.

### Debug : 0.0.1

First release in debug mode on the test/publish branch and deploy on [surge](http://test.procedural-dungeon.surge.sh/).

With this mode you have access to a panel to manipulate the different variables and function of the player and enemies.

> There is still some bug like the update of the player's life of not doing if we increase these points of life
> or the panels for the enemies is not removed when the player kills it ...

Enjoy !

### Typescript : 0.0.1

For the Hacktoberfest event I decided to run the game under the typescript language in order to bring a stronger structure to the code, perhaps a bit complex and above all, better readability of the code.

the game sandbox and always available at the following url: [surge](http://test.procedural-dungeon.surge.sh/)
